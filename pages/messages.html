            <h1>WEEKLY MESSAGE</h1>
            <h3>WHOSE REPORT DO YOU BELIEVE</h3>
            <div class="verse">
                 <span>[Numbers 13:27]</span> Then they told him, and said: "We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this [is] its fruit. 
                 <sup>28</sup> Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land [are] strong; the cities [are] fortified [and] very large; moreover we saw the descendants of Anak there. 
                 <sup>29</sup>  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan. 
                 <sup>30</sup> Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, "Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it. 
                 <sup>31</sup> But the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they [are] stronger than we. 
                 <sup>32</sup> And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, "The land through which we have gone as spies [is] a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it [are] men of [great] stature. 
                 <sup>33</sup> There we saw the giants (the descendants of Anak came from the giants); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight." (NKJV)
                <br><br> Negativity, bad reports, lack, sickness, discouragement, poverty spoken to you by people, demons or bad experiences as long as it's not desirable and pleasing to you it's not of God. Posture your heart in such a way of partaking that which God says belongs to you. The Lord prepared the children of Israel through Moses on how to partake and enter the promised Land but you see many failed to enter because they thought the entering was physical and yet you need to first enter in spiritually and then physically. And the men that set their hearts accordingly like Joshua and Caleb you actually see that they entered the Land before they possessed it in the physical. Joshua and Caleb carried a different report unlike others, they were convinced about possessing the land and not even the report of their colleagues could make them change their minds otherwise. Never let anything or any person draw you away from what you believe God can do.
                <br><br> <span>[Hebrews 4:11]</span> let us labor, therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience.
                The labor/diligence to enter in must be in the spirit; Your mind and heart should be consumed by that you must envision your self first into what God has actually released then you will see it come easily in the physical. And the physical place which is More comfortable bigger and better shall come so easily because you shall have entered in the reality of the spirit already. I pray that you will enter the reality of this message and see your world change this week in Jesus name.
